# 0x1E-search_algorithms

This project is part of <b>ALX Software Engineering Program.</b> It focuses on a different kinds of searching algorithms like:

* Linear Search
* Binary Search
* Jump Search
* Interpolation Search
* Exponential Search

# What I learned?

* I learned how to implement each searching algorithms listed above.
* I understood which searching algorithm works best for a given senario.
* Which algorithm is have a best time complexity for a given task.
* I learned the Best, Average and Worst case of their time and space complexity.
